lets all make it a common goal to complete our fasfa before the deadline march 1 2014 
knowledge is power 
go to   click on the fasfa day icon on the right hand side of the bottom screen 
you should bring 1 ssn 2 parents ssn if dependent 3 fasfa pin 4 2013 1040 5 proof of untaxed income #wssufinaid 
wondering how much aid you're elgible for  
most teen workers don't save for college  
the fiveminute fasfa  
if your parents are divorced or separated it’s based on the parent you spent the most time with in the previous year 
if you have your 1040 income tax return available the form can be fairly straightforward 
the majority of colleges also use the fafsa to determine who qualifies for their own institutional needbased aid 
the fafsa helps determine the awarding of over 150 billion in federal aid as well as state aid 
it’s available online at  not dot com not dot org not dot anything else 
fafsa stands for free application for federal student aid 
hence it’s free #wssufinaid 
the fafsa is the form required at all colleges that accept and award federal aid 
my family won't qualify for needbased grants so i shouldn't bother completing the free application for federal student aid fafsa #myth
